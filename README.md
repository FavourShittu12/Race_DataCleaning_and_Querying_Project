# Race_DataCleaning_and_Querying_Project
This project explores the performance differences in race completion times between male and female participants in the 50k and 50-mile races, as well as the impact of age on performance.

--Project Overview--
-The dataset used in this analysis includes race completion times and participant demographics for various events. The primary objectives of this analysis are:

-Speed Comparison: Analyze the difference in average completion speeds between male and female participants in both the 50k and 50-mile races.

-Top Age Groups: Identify the age groups that demonstrate the best performance in the 50-mile race, focusing on those who have participated in a minimum of 10 races.

-Underperforming Age Groups: Determine the age groups that exhibit the worst performance in the 50-mile race, again considering participants with a minimum of 10 races.

--Methodology--
-Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. Missing values were addressed, and irrelevant columns were removed.
-Data Visualization: Tables and graphs were created to illustrate findings clearly and effectively.
-Statistical Analysis: Various statistical methods were employed to derive insights and answer the research questions.
--Results--
The analysis provides a comprehensive look at gender performance differences and age-related trends in ultra-distance racing. Insights from this project can help inform training strategies for runners and contribute to discussions on gender and age equity in sports.
